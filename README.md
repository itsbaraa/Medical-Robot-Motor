# Medical Robot Motor and Programming

This repo outlines the selection of a robot type, an appropriate motor, and a conceptual programming example.

### 1. Robot Selection

A **Surgical Assistant Robot Arm** was selected. These robots are used in surgery to manipulate instruments with the extreme precision and stability that medical procedures demand.

### 2. Motor Selection and Justification

**Motor Choice:** Hybrid Closed-Loop Stepper Motor.

**Justification:**

This motor is ideal for a surgical robot. It combines the precise, discrete movement of a stepper motor with the reliability of a closed-loop feedback system (via an encoder), which corrects any errors. Its most critical feature is a very high **holding torque**, allowing the robot to hold an instrument perfectly stationary without vibration or drift, which is essential for patient safety.

### 3. Programming Example

The following conceptual code for an Arduino platform demonstrates the basic control of a single joint. It uses the `AccelStepper` library to move a stepper motor between two precise positions, simulating the movement of a surgical arm joint.

**Code:**

```cpp
#include <AccelStepper.h>

// Define motor connections and type
#define motorInterfaceType 4
#define dirPin 2
#define stepPin 3

// Create a stepper object
AccelStepper joint_stepper(motorInterfaceType, stepPin, dirPin);

void setup() {
  // Set motion parameters for smooth movement
  joint_stepper.setMaxSpeed(1000);
  joint_stepper.setAcceleration(500);
}

void loop() {
  // Move to the first position (e.g., 50 steps)
  joint_stepper.moveTo(50);
  joint_stepper.runToPosition();
  delay(2000); // Hold position

  // Move to the second position (e.g., -50 steps)
  joint_stepper.moveTo(-50);
  joint_stepper.runToPosition();
  delay(2000); // Hold position
}
```
